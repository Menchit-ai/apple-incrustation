# apple-incrustation notebooks

## Content

This folder store all my research work. This work are notebooks that contains a lot of functions (basically all that are in my lib come from those notebooks) that I tested. I selected my functions based on my experience and my eyes. But some might be upgrade and combine to obtain better algorithm.

## Files

- **Apple incrustation** : a mess full of tests that contains the major part of all my tests, it can almost be considered as a main script.
- **Depth apple** : testing my wrapper around the monodepth2 model.
- **light application** : generating the masks for adjust the light on objects.
- **light estimation** : finding the light direction on a background and transform it in a vector.
- **shadow estimation** : test baout finding the shadow direction with the same reflexion used in light estimation (not used at the end).
